# Marble Gambling
A game where the user starts with £1000 and by random chance, wins or loses money. The user places a bet, size of their choice, and a random marble is pulled from a bag. If the marble is green, the user wins the bet, if red the user loses the bet, if black the user wins 10x the bet and if white, the user loses 5x the bet. There are 5 green marbles, 3 red marbles and one of both white and black.

## Project Status
Complete with room for improvement.

## Example of project function

The program, when run, will initially ask the user to place a bet. The initial purse is £1000. If the purse subceeds £500 or the user inputs a non-integer as their bet, the game will end.

The program will return what marble was extracted from the bag, how much is won/lost and how much money is in the purse.

> A Green marble was chosen.
You have won £500. You now have £1500.

If the bet placed is greater than what is in the purse, the program will ask the user to input a different number.

## Room for improvement
- A greater range of marbles with quirky perks can be included.
